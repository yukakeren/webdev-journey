# Ata's Journey to Become a Web Developer
I will be documenting my path to become a web developer without AI tools since I felt like I will panic if [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com) ever went down again.

## 📍 Plan
I will be doing a project based learning to hopefully help me jumps faster. 
1. Build a responsive website with this [course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design-v9/)
2. Build a studycase
3. Build a portfolio

It's pretty simple right? Hopefully so.

## 📖 What I learn

1. **HTML** \
    HTML is a Hypertext Markup Language is a markup language for creating web pages. There is a header `<h1>` to `<h6>`. What distinguishes the bracket between the start and the end is a slash **/**. However, some elements does not have a closing tag. It is called a **void element** for example:
    ```html
    <img />
    ```
