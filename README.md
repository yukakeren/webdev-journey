# Ata's Journey to Become a Web Developer
I will be documenting my path to become a web developer without ai tools since I felt like I will panic if 
[Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com) ever went down again.

## 📍 Plan
I will be doing a project based learning to hopefully help me jumps faster. 
1. Built a responsive website with this [course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design-v9/)
4. Built a studycase
5. Built a portfolio

It's pretty simple right? Hopefully so.
